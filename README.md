# Prototyp Peck application

This app was created by STPL to be deployed to Williams college to provide calendaring services through a mobile application. It's design is a useful starting point, but the new application will be built largely from scratch using updated technologies and techniques as well as new UX design concepts.

The app is designed in a singleton pattern, with the AppDelegate holding the information crucial throughout the app. It contacts the API, also created by STPL, through a series of hard-coded web addresses that the singleton inherits. Each view within the app has its own associated class, making modifications difficult, but the relationship between everything relatively straightforward.

Aaron has spent a lot of time looking through the app, so if you have any qestions about how it operated he may be able to assist.
